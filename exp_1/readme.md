1.  Basic signals: Generate the following discrete time signals for n=-10 to +10 and display
    the following in separate figures using “stem” Matlab function:
    a. Unit impulse δ [n]
    b. Unit step u[n]
    c. u[n-1]
    d. Do in lab (15 marks): Generate unit impulse δ [ n ]using u[n] and u[n-1]
    e. Do in lab (15 marks):: Unit ramp r[n], and also x[n]=r[2n] in one figure (using
       Matlab’s hold) with appropriate legend and title for n=-20 to +20.
    f. Generate unit step u [ n ] using r[n] and r[n-1].
    
2.  Perform the following using the stem function.
    a. Let x[n] = 20(0.9)n u[n].
      i. Choose c and generate y[n] =10(c)n u[n], which reaches zero slower than x[n]
      ii. Display x[n] and y[n] for n=-10 to +100 on the same plot with appropriate
          legend (using hold).
    b. Do in lab (10 marks): Let x[n] = 0.2(1.2)n u[n]
      i. Choose c and generate y[n] = 2(c) n u[n], which reaches infinity slower
         than x[.].
      ii. Display x[n] and y[n] for n=-10 to +100 on the same plot with appropriate
          legend (using hold).
    c. Generate and display following discrete time signals for n=-10 to +40 on the same
    plot using hold with appropriate legend:
      i. x[n] = (-0.8)n u[n]
      ii. x[n] = -(0.8)n u[n]
    d. Do in lab (10 marks): Generate complex exponential signal x[n] =e(-1/12 +jπ/6)n .
      i. Display the real part and imaginary parts of x[n] for n=0 to 20 in one
         subplot of one figure with appropriate legend.
      ii. Display the absolute value of x[n] for n=0 to 20 in another subplot of the
          same figure.
